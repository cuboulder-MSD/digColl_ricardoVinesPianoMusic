# Ricardo Vines Piano Music Collection
## Description
A champion of new music, the Catalan pianist Ricardo Viñes (1875-1943) compiled a library of piano scores by his contemporaries that documents a particularly fertile period in the history of piano music. The Viñes collection at the University of Colorado is comprised of 829 pieces of sheet music acquired by Viñes from the 1880s through the 1930s. With few exceptions, the collection consists of music actually composed and published during those years. Many of the scores are unique to CU Boulder. The collection offers a view not necessarily of what we have come to know as the standard repertoire of the era, but of a broad cross-section of the composers who were active at the time. The majority of works in the collection are by French composers; Russian, Italian and Latin American contemporaries are also well represented. Highlights include works by Mily Aleksey Balakirev, Charles-Wilfrid Bériot, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Emmanuel Chabrier, Hans Franco-Mendes, Sergey Lyapunov, Maurice Ravel, Camille Saint-Saëns, Florent Schmitt, Theodor Szántó, Joaquín Turina, Raoul de Verneuil, and Alberto Williams. This digital collection includes about two-thirds of the Viñes collection. More materials will be added as they are digitized.
